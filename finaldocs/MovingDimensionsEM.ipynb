      "Electromagnetic (EM) methods are used to characterize the electrical conductivity distribution of the earth. Since EM methods consider time-varying fields, we typically treat EM in either the frequency domain (FD) or the time domain (TD). Recently, due in part to computational advances, EM geophysical surveys are increasingly being simulated and inverted in 3D. However, the availability of computational resources does not invalidate the use of lower dimensional formulations and methods, which can be useful depending on the geological complexity as well as the survey geometry. For example, we can treat the measured EM data either in TD or FD, and a progressive procedure can be used to invert these data, starting with 1D inversions, then moving to multi-dimensional inversions. As such, we require a set of tools that allow a geophysicists to easily move between dimensions and formulations of the EM problem. This is the motivation behind the open source software package SimPEG-EM which is part of a software ecosystem for Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics (SimPEG). In this study, we will share examples as well as our experience from creating a range of simulation and inversion tools for EM methods that span dimensions (1D, 2D and 3D) and apply TD formulations in a consistent framework. The flexibility and consistency in our EM package allows us to be methodical so that we have the capacity to tackle a spectrum of problems in EM geophysics."

To perform this geophysical inversion process, a generic quetion that we need to ask ourselves is \"what is the model?\" in your inversion. Natural choice can be discretized 3D voxel of conductivity: $\\sigma (x, y, z)$, because we need this discretized model to compute forward response. However, in most of EM inversions we set our model parameter as $m (x, y, z) = log (\\sigma(x, y, z))$, considering scale of variation in conductivity and positivity of the conductivity. This clearly shows that model parameter in geophysical inversion does not necessarily have to be same as distribution of physical property.

One of the key to treat this problem is to recognize the distribution of highly saturated zone by seawater. Ground loop EM suvey has been used to detect intruded seawater, because of highly conductive nature of seawater. Figure 2 shows typcial ground TEM geometry and conceptual geology near coastal area. By putting time-varying current through the transmitter loop, we excite the earth. Fundamental physics here is different from direct current (DC) survey, given that we do not pump the electric charges to the ground. Rather, we use EM induction phenomenon to excite the earth in this case, which has high sensitivity on conductive structure. As a geophyscists, we want to suggest possible region where we have serious seawater intrusion. Therefore, for geophysicsts, recovering conductivity distribution, which has high correlation with seawater saturation can be a principal task. "

We use simple layered earth model (1D) to make this analyses simple, and ground loop source is circular thus, survey parameters are distance from the center of the loop ($r$) and time. We perform two forward responses due to the layered model with seawater layer and without seawater layer, and compute amplitude ratio of them. Because we measure vertical component of magnetic flux density ($b_z$), amplitude ratio that we compute can be written as $\\frac{b_z[\\sigma_{seawater}]}{b_z[\\sigma_{background}]}$. In Figure 3b, we provide amplitude ratio in 2D plane of which axes are time and $r$. Contours on high amplitude ratios clearly shows measured response at time range $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}s$ are sensitive to the seawater, and most of $r$ for corresponding time range."

      "Using mapping function in our geophysical inversion, we clearly decouple inversion model space from physical model space. This enables us to set arbitrary inversion model. We set three different inversion models, which are 1D, 2D and 3D using mapping function, and performed TEM inversions for seawater intrusion problem. Each inversion showed reasonable recovered model based on the mapping for each case. Although we treated limited subset of inversion models such as 1D, 2D and 3D, general definition of mapping function that we suggested can be extended to numerous different inversion models. For instance, we can ask a specific question: \"where is the boundary of fresh and seawater?\" in our geophysical inversion using this mapping function. We believe this separation of inversion model from physical property model will be a powerful concept in our geophysical inversion, which allow us not only to answer conventional question on our tasks in geophyics, but also ask very specific questions about certain geological feature of the earth system.
